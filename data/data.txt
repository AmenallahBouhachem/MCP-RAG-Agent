Question 47: What’s the difference between bagging and boosting?  
Answer 47: Bagging builds independent models in parallel on random subsets to reduce variance; boosting builds sequential models that focus on correcting predecessors’ errors to reduce bias.

Question 48: When is it appropriate to use a support vector machine?  
Answer 48: SVMs excel on smaller to medium-sized datasets with clear margins between classes and work well with high-dimensional feature spaces.

Question 49: How do gradient boosting machines work?  
Answer 49: They sequentially add decision trees that minimize the overall loss by fitting to the negative gradients (residuals) of the loss function.

Question 50: What is the purpose of a residual plot?  
Answer 50: It visualizes prediction errors versus predicted values or input features to detect non‑random patterns indicating model misspecification.

Question 51: How do I check for multicollinearity?  
Answer 51: Compute Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) scores or examine correlation matrices; high VIF (>5 or 10) suggests multicollinearity that may require feature removal or regularization.
